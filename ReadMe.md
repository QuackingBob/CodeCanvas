# CodeCanvas

#### What is this?

This is just a simple program that helps create code snippet images. I often find myself needing a lot of them for HW or other assignments/projects so this just makes it easy to organize them. You can open a project folder and in it, add code cells for various languages. Then you can download images for each snippet.

#### How to Run?

```bash
python codecanvas.py
```
